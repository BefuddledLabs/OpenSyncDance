# Dance Wishlist

You can help us by sending us your dances! Unfortunately we can't use most online resources because that would fall under redistribution (_dang you copyright!_), which means no MMD motion files or Mixamo animations.

## Motion Capping

A maybe more easy way to help is to mocap yourself dancing with something like [ShaderMotion](https://gitlab.com/lox9973/ShaderMotion).
You can use a VRChat world that already has that all setup, e.g. [MOCAP Studio](https://vrchat.com/home/world/wrld_859d580d-ff9c-4545-84ba-682440f64857).

In the above world, you will need to put the stream camera inside the red camera sphere.
This adds two bars on the side that contains the motion data.
Then record the VRChat window with something like OBS.
After recording yourself dancing, you can use the [ShaderMotion WebPlayer](https://lox9973.com/ShaderMotion/player-gltf.html) to preview and export the motion data as an animation.

Once you have the animation, feel free to open a pull request, open an issue, or contact `nara` or `deltaneverused` on Discord to get it added here.

## The List

Here's a list of things that we would be _really super radical_ to add, but we're bad dancers so this list is up for grabs! Do let us know if you're going to work on anything here so someone else doesn't take it. If you just wanna do your own dances, feel free to improvise be creative!
